# Recommendations 

Using this file for recommendations of Linux distributions others have given me.

1) [PopOS](https://system76.com/pop)


2) [SolusProject](https://getsol.us/home/) -recommended by @NigelGreenway. " I'm sure you've had many suggestions on an os, but thought I'd suggest @SolusProject. I use it with Budgie desktop, but there is a Gnome and Mate version to. It's very well put together and budgie is a great environment. As a software Eng. I've found it perfect" 


3) [Antergos]() - muliple recommendations 
   
   @Eugene__619 " I'm using that OS right now. It's like manjaro. Arch based and has two package managers."

    @thekbknapp
   " * Feels like an Ubuntu base (stability wise) * Linked to large company (gives me warm and fuzzies about quality/stability) * Up to date packages * RPMs are everywhere; it's easy to find packages not in official repos * Flatpak support is great * Copr is like Arch AURA 
    * SELinux (although the only error I've had in at least a year was when installing LXD via snap), and it can be turned off too. * KDE Spin requires installing proprietary codecs via CLI (Gnome is via friendly GUI prompt)"
